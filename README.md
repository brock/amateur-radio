## Radio Images

Each directory is unique to a specific radio with an `.img` file and a `.csv` file. The image files can be loaded directly onto the same model of radio using the [Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) software. The CSV file is there to easily see what is in the image files.
