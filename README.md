## Champaign-Urbana Frequencies
The following image and csv file provide you with most of the active channels in the surrounding area (Champaign-Urbana, IL). I've also included GMRS and FRS stations, though you shouldn't transmit on those above 1 watt or 0.5 watts, respectively.

Load these using the [Chirp](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) software.
* `cu.img` - an image file you can use to load into Chirp. Only tested with the Baofeng UV-5RA.
* `cu.csv` - an csv export of the image file.
